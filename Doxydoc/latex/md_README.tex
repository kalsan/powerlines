Source code for Powerlines ( www.\+powerlines.\+ch.\+vu )~\newline
 I wrote Powerlines while learning C++ in grade school. At that time, I had absolutely no knowledge about programming and therefore, the original coding style is horrible. I tried to enhance the code 5 years later, starting with version 2-\/2, but I don\textquotesingle{}t have enough spare time to rewrite the entire program. I understand that the result is still not state-\/of-\/the-\/art, but I hope it somehow readable \+:-\/)~\newline
 I\textquotesingle{}m planning on get everything more object-\/oriented. As this is a hobby project, it could be done whenever.
